# PRS-web-cv

An interactive web CV designed to showcase my skills and completed projects in a visual and dynamic way. It serves as an online platform where users can explore my experiences and achievements.

> This project is currently a work in progress and is primarily intended as a test. It is definitely not complete yet, with several features still under development, such as mobile responsiveness and other key aspects. More improvements and refinements will be made in future updates.
